<div class="goals">Travel and Expenses</div>
<div class="info">
Past workshops have consisted of two half-days.
  As this yearâ€™s workshop is on the west coast requiring additional time for travel for most participants,
  there was widespread interest in a longer conference. Contingent on sufficient supply of quality papers,
  we are planning for as much as two full days (Tuesday and Wednesday) with travel on Monday and Thursday.
  While we encourage participants to attend the entire workshop, we will be sensitive to scheduling needs for
  those who can only stay for one day.
</div>
<div class="empty-box"></div>
<div class="info">
There are no registration fees. Meals will be covered by Claremont McKenna College.
Participants will likely be responsible for their own travel and lodging expenses.
  We are currently attempting to secure additional funding to assist with these costs
  but can make no guarantees at this point.
</div>
<div class="empty-box"></div>
<div class="info">
  We will provide group rates for a variety of hotel options.
  This will be facilitated by your non-binding notification of hotel preferences upon registration.
  We will also help coordinate ride-sharing to and from the airport and from hotels to campus to
  reduce the demand for rental cars.

<div class="info">
The closest airport is Ontario (California), a 15 minute car ride from campus.
Flying into LAX may reduce the number of connections at the cost of a longer ride to campus (50 minutes plus traffic) and a more hectic airport.
